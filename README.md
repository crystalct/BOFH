BOFH: Servers Under Siege
-------------------------
It's a fan-made video game for the PC and the C64 developed by Covert Bitops. Based on the Bastard Operator from Hell stories, the game features the titular BOFH finding out that his workplace has been taken over by terrorists. However, said terrorists let all the people in the building leave and have instead took the computers hostage, and planted bombs inside the server racks. The BOFH decides that the logical course of action is to eliminate all the terrorists single-handedly and sneaks in.

In both versions, the goal is to defuse all the bombs in the server racks across the buildings and defeat the terrorist leaders on the sixth floor. The two versions feature similar gameplay with slight differences.

The game, in both of its versions, is available on the [Covert Bitops website](https://cadaver.github.io/).
